# Guessing-Game
First Python Program. A Fun little guessing game that utilizes control flow through the specific ordering of if/elif statements to ensure that the program runs correctly.

The Guessing Game where a random number between -10,000 and 10,000 is generated and the player has to guess that number.

If the player guesses a number that isn't between -10,000 and 10,000, then they get an "OUT OF BOUNDS" message, and if they guess the same number then they get a "You've already guessed this number silly!" message.
